# üêæ Pet Management Platform

This platform allows users to register their pets, update their information, and track their health information. Conceptually, it is designed for veterinary service organizations to register animals that come in for treatment and to track their treatment history. The purpose of the application is to securely store and track pet treatment information on the ICP.
